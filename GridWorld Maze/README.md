# Introduction
The agent is placed in a maze environment with different states and rewards. The goal of the agent is to accumulate maximal utilities over iterations by following an optimal policy

# Overview:
A simple maze environment is provided, with each state having different utility values.

A more complicated maze environment, with a larger size and randomly initiated elements, is also created.

<br> - For both maze environments, Reinforcement Learning algorithms, such as value iteration and policy iteration, are used to compute an optimal policy.
<br> - The utilities of each state are also recorded, to show the convergence of utilities over iterations.

# Results:
- An optimal policy was derived for both maze environments, using both algorithms.
